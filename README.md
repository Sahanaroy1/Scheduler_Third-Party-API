# Scheduler_Third-Party-API

## User Story

* This week's challenge we need to create a simple calender application to save daily event for each hour from 9am to 5pm. It is to be done by modifying the starter code. It is modified with Jquery and bootstrap.

* The current date is modified with the Day.js (a Javascript library). To manage the time effectively the important events are saved in the daily planner.

 ## Acceptance Criteria
* It's done when the current date and time is displayed on the top of the page on page load.
* It's done when  the timeblocks is displayed from 9:00am - 5:00pm on page load.
* It's presented with colour code.
* It's done when passed time is shown in grey, present time is shown in red and future time diplayed in green.
* Its done when text is entered in the timeblock and click the save button a message is displayed at the top of the page that data is stored in the local storage.
* It's done when the displayed message disappears after 5 secs.
* It's done when the previously saved messages are displayed on page load.
